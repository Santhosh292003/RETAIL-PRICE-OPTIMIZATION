# RETAIL PRICE OPTIMIZATION

The Retail Price Optimization project employs cutting-edge machine learning to revolutionize retail pricing strategies.
By integrating price elasticity modeling, demand forecasting, real-time competitive analysis, and personalized
promotions, this model dynamically adapts to market fluctuations.

The proposed hybrid model captures intricate pricing patterns, encompassing linear, non-linear, and temporal
variations. 

This enhances the accuracy and robustness of the model compared to single-model approaches.
SHAP-based interpretability feature provides transparency, enabling stakeholders to comprehend the key factors
influencing pricing decisions.
